          Ever wanted passive income? A real paycheck that comes every month
          without you having to work for it? Ever wanted to collect rent each
          month from a steady source like real estate but you didn't have the
          cash or credit plus you didn't want to deal with tenants, clogged
          toilets or water heaters going out? What if there was a Virtual Real
          Estate? A product that you could buy and lease out that paid you a
          generous, steady paycheck each and every month with no risk and no
          landlord hassles? What if that product was in the booming field of
          block chain technology but without all the risk or volatility of
          Bitcoin and others. What if I told you that you could earn 5% per
          month, (see package explanation), on your product each month, that
          your purchase was tax deductible*, that your 5 year lease contract was
          backed by a multi-million dollar hedge fund and above all else your
          principal was guaranteed by a major insurance company through its
          Total Protection Plus program? We are talking about a $15,000 purchase
          of a guaranteed product that will pay you $750 per month in passive
          income lease payments for 5 years! All you have to do is go to the
          mailbox and get your check each month! Want more than $750? How much
          more? You just purchase more Enduro servers and collect $1,500,
          $4,500, $7,500 or more! You decide. Don't have any savings? We even
          have a great solution for you Millennials and others. Just click on
          the No Money Button at the top of the page for more information. Oh,
          and the icing on the cake is that at the end of the term, in addition
          to the lease payments, basically tripling your money, you can also
          receive all of your original investment back too! Would you be
          interested in hearing a little more about that too? Keep reading....
          We live in turbulent economic times. You cannot pick up a newspaper or
          watch the news without hearing about some kind of financial risk.
          Stock market at an all time high. But who can forget 2008? Real estate
          market in another bubble? The signs are all around us that there will
          be another correction sometime soon. Put your money in the bank to
          earn a measly 1-2%? That does not even keep pace with the most
          conservative figures of inflation! What is a person supposed to do?
          Take a few moments to review the Enduro Solution. It is the most
          amazing cash flow generating product whose time has come and is
          perfectly poised to the best investment of the 21st century. But we
          should not call it an investment because that implies that there is
          some risk. Some down side. But with the Enduro Solution the risk has
          been eliminated and the downside erased. How? Please review the
          Overview tab. But in a nutshell: You purchase an Enduro Server
          package(s) Your server is then automatically leased back to Enduro to
          do its data mining and data storage functions. You receive a check
          every month for 5 years basically tripling your money. At the end of
          that term the server is worn out and basically you are done, unless of
          course you continue to buy more servers. The return is 5% per month so
          there is no better place to put your hard earned money. You fill out
          the form to request the return of your original purchase price from
          the insurance company. You can get 33% back at the end of the 5 years
          or the whole 100% back after a total of 10 years. Either way this
          icing on the cake should not be ignored.
